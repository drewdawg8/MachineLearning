## MachineLearning

Different types of Machine Learning algorithms that I'm working on using Keras with Tensorflow backend.

# Text Classifier

* Trained on approximately 25000 samples and tested on around the same amount.

* After about 6 epochs the validation accuracy is around 86% and training accuracy is around 99%
